TODO list:

Before stable release:
Delete vocal feedback for move commands unless good reason to keep it.

Known bugs:
- ctrl+alt+M quickly: may say nothing or wrong value.

Test all features on Win7 and filter if required, including logon screen

Possible code enhancement (to investigate):
- use notify instead of polling registry value
- Investigate: Add a way to open only once reg key
- Try to move layered command framework in a separate dedicated class

New features investigation:
* Announce zoom when clicking on + or - in Magnifier UI (and when using control+alt+mouseWheel)
  -> Tried to define event_nameChange to announce a change of the zoom factor label. The event handler is not called.
  - Tried to look at events with AccEvent, I get the following line:
  OBJ_NAMECHANGE	 idChild=0 [Error: getting object: hr=0x80004005 - Erreur non spécifiée]
  i.e. "Unspecified error"
* See if possible to implement moveToCaret/Focus/Mouse scripts. See:
  - For mouse, tried to activate mouse tracking and mouseTrackingMode=inTheCenterOfTheScreen and to make slightly move the mouse cursor (via winUser.setCursorPos).
  -> This works when the mouse cursor is in the magnified view or next to it, but not when it is too far from magnified view..
  -> See if more success for caret or focus by fireing associated windows events.
  - Try to compute the number of left/right/up/down pane required to get mouse/caret/focus next to the center of the view and send programmatically control+alt+arrow to move the view.
  -> To do
* mouseToView:
  - full screen: already implemented
  - docked: tried to get the source of magnified view via magnifier API, but unsuccessful.
  - lens: not applicable: the zoomed view has always the mouse in center since this is the way the lens works.
* Beep when paning the view if we reached bhe screen edge. Or configurable (nothing, beep, message).
* Make paning commands feedback configurable (nothing, beep or direction); at least config without UI.
