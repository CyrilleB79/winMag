- ctrl+alt+M quickly: may say nothing or wrong value.

Test all features on Win7 and filter if required, including logon screen

Possible code enhancement (to investigate):
- use notify instead of polling registry value
- Investigate: Add a way to open only once reg key
- Try to move layered command framework in a separate dedicated class
